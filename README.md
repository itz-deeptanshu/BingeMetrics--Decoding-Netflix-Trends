# BingeMetrics: Decoding Netflix Trends

This project performs an end-to-end data science pipeline on a comprehensive Netflix catalog dataset from Kaggle. The objective is twofold: to uncover streaming content patterns through deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and to build a predictive classification model determining whether a given title should be classified as a TV Show or a Movie.

## 🔍 Analysis Covered
 
### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handling null values across `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, and `rating`
- Parsing `date_added` into datetime format
- Extracting `month_added` and `year_added` as features
### 2. Content Distribution
- Movies vs. TV Shows split
- Year-wise content addition trends
- Monthly addition patterns (which months Netflix adds the most)
### 3. Geographic Analysis
- Top 10 countries producing Netflix content
- Country-wise breakdown of Movies vs. TV Shows
### 4. Genre / Category Analysis
- Most common genres (via `listed_in` column parsing)
- Genre overlap using frequency plots
### 5. Rating Analysis
- Distribution of content ratings (`TV-MA`, `PG-13`, `R`, etc.)
- Rating breakdown by content type
### 6. Duration Analysis
- Movie runtime distribution (minutes)
- TV Show season count distribution
### 7. Director & Cast Insights
- Top 10 most featured directors
- Top 10 most cast actors/actresses
